These might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involving people who know the person well<\/li>\n<li>Giving the person information about the decision in the format they are most likely to understand<\/li>\n<li>Communicating with them in ways they generally use<\/li>\n<li>Visiting them more than once, in case their abilities change at different times<\/li>\n<li>People need to be relaxed and as confident as possible, so they will need to be in the place they know, and probably with people they know.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Getting these elements in place will frame the way that you establish the person\u2019s capacity to make this decision. <strong>Remember that the process of assessment is not about seeking specific responses from the person to pre-determined questions, rather it about using your judgement to weigh evidence that the person understands that<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They need care or support<\/li>\n<li>Their care or support has to be paid for<\/li>\n<li>There are different ways to get care or support<\/li>\n<li>They can choose who will support them<\/li>\n<li>If they choose their own support, they will be responsible for paying for it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You should also bear in mind that a key test of capacity laid out in the Mental Capacity Act is a person\u2019s ability to communicate a decision. You will therefore need to be aware of how the person normally communicates when making your assessment.<\/p>\n<figure>Although it may take time to prepare for an assessment of capacity, the assessment itself and any best interests decisions that follow can take place within existing person-centred planning meetings. This may allow you to consult with others regarding their views of the person\u2019s mental capacity.<\/figure>\n<p><strong>Keep a record of how the assessment of capacity was carried out.<\/strong> It is good practice to keep a note of the steps you took to establish whether or not the person had capacity to consent to have a direct payment. You should also write down the conclusions you came to and your reasons for your decision.<\/p>\n<h3>Who decides?<\/h3>\n<p>The person making the mental capacity assessment will usually be the social care practitioner involved with the person\u2019s community care assessment or support planning.<\/p>\n<figure>Remember that people eligible for support and their families are often involved in different assessments by health and social care staff and may not distinguish between them. Indeed you should already have made a separate assessment of the person\u2019s eligibility for community care funding from the council.<\/figure>\n<p>[case_study number=\"1\"]<\/p>\n<p>However, it may not always be possible to reach a conclusion about the person\u2019s mental capacity and <strong>you may need to seek a second opinion if you are unsure about their capacity to make this decision, or someone (including the person) disagrees with your assessment.<\/strong> A second opinion may be sought from a colleague or manager, or someone with specialist skills such as a psychologist, other specialist clinician, therapist or social care practitioner.<\/p>\n<figure>You can audit your assessment of capacity using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amcat.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">AMCAT<\/a> an online tool specifically designed to help practitioners improve the way they assess mental capacity.<\/figure>\n<p><strong>It is important for the practitioner, the person concerned and their family to be clear why the assessment of capacity needs to be completed.<\/strong> Make sure that the person and their family have information about direct payments and the Mental Capacity Act.<\/p>\n<p>Hft\u2019s Family Carers Support Service (a national charity) has an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hft.org.uk\/Supporting-people\/family-carers\/Resources\/MCA-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\">MCA resource<\/a> specifically designed for family carers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you conclude that the person does have mental capacity to consent to a direct payment <\/strong>you will still need to have a conversation with them about the options available \u2013 for example, using a mix of council services and support that they arrange for themselves.

The Code sets out the responsibilities of decision-makers and offers useful guidance about the process of making a decision and acting in someone\u2019s best interests.<\/p>\n<figure>Is the person likely to regain\u00a0capacity; for example, after receiving medical treatment? If so, you may be able to wait until the person is able to decide for themselves.<\/figure>\n<p>[case_study number=\"3\"]<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is a best interests decision?<\/strong> A decision or action that is taken in someone\u2019s best interests must consider and take into account what the person may have decided for themselves, if they did have capacity.<\/p>\n<p>The Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice sets out a <strong>best interests checklist <\/strong> that will help you make a judgement. The following are some of the things you should bear in mind when making a best interests decision about whether or not the person should have an indirect payment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid assumptions<\/strong> about the person\u2019s best interests\u00a0merely on the basis of their age or appearance, condition or any\u00a0aspect of their behaviour. For example, do not assume that an indirect payment would not suit a person with a learning disability simply because no-one with a learning disability has ever had one in your local authority.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Consider all the circumstances relevant to the decision<\/strong>. In this situation vital piece of information is whether there is a person (or people) who could fulfill the role of \u2018suitable person\u2019? This is someone, often a relative or family carer, who is willing, able and suitable to take on responsibility for managing the indirect payment and making decisions about how it will be spent.<\/p>\n<p>The Guidance on Direct Payments makes it clear that before making an indirect payment to someone lacking capacity, <strong>you must first<\/strong> <strong>obtain the consent of the suitable person<\/strong> to receive direct payments on behalf of the person lacking capacity. You must be satisfied that the suitable person understands the role, is willing to take it on and will at in the person\u2019s best interests.<\/p>\n<p>In making the decision you should also <strong>consider alternative ways of meeting the person\u2019s needs<\/strong>, other than an indirect payment. For example, there may be a council-run service that meets the person\u2019s needs. You should also consider whether a mixture of support funded through indirect payments and council provision would best meet the person\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<p>[case_study number=\"4\"]<\/p>\n<p>Where there is more than one option you must <strong>consider if there is a course of action that will be less restrictive of the person\u2019s basic rights and freedom.<\/strong> This is not just about physical freedom. Living in a place that enables the person to maintain regular contact with family and friends may be the most important factor in establishing the option that is in their best interests.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that although the person lacks capacity to make this decision, they may be able to make a significant contribution to the process by telling you about their <strong>likes and dislikes, feelings, beliefs and values.<\/strong> Other people may be able to tell you how best to communicate with the person and what the person has said about these things in the past.<\/p>\n<p>[case_study number=\"5\"]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Consult with other people about what is likely to be in the person\u2019s best interests.<\/strong>\u00a0This will include anyone who already has formal decision-making powers on behalf of the person, as an appointee for benefits, court-appointed deputies and attorneys appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), carers, close relatives and anyone else with a genuine and active interest in the person\u2019s welfare.<\/p>\n<figure>Remember to involve the person who lacks capacity and other people at all stages in the decision-making process. This will improve the quality of the final decision and the actions that flow from it (such as, appointing a suitable person), as well as reducing the chances of disagreement.<\/figure>\n<p><strong>If people are to be properly involved in a best interests decision they will need good, clear information about indirect payments<\/strong>. You should feel confident about explaining this to them, but it is also worth finding out about information and support that you can guide them to.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A best interests process doesn\u2019t always mean a formal meeting.<\/strong> Indeed meetings are rarely the best way of enabling the person to be involved in the process. It\u2019s about consultation and conversation. For example, both an assessment of capacity and a best interests process can take place within existing person-centred planning meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the social care practitioner will be the ultimate decision maker regarding an indirect payment, you should aim to reach a decision that is supported by everyone who will be involved in implementing it. <strong>Keep a record of the decision, how it was reached and any disagreements<\/strong> that have been expressed.<\/p>\n<figure>Some young people under the age of 18 use direct payments that are managed by their parents. As they reach adulthood the council will need to consider with the young person and their family whether to continue using direct payments and, if they lack capacity to decide this, whether it is in the person\u2019s best interests to have an indirect payment.<\/figure>\n<p>[case_study number=\"6\"]<\/p>\n<figure><a title=\"Best Interests Decision Evaluation Tool (BRIDGET)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bestinterests.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">The BRIDGET online tool <\/a>allows you to audit a best interests decision that you have made.<\/figure>\n<figure>You should remind anyone acting as a suitable person that they only have authority to make certain decisions about the person\u2019s financial affairs and that they should always seek the person\u2019s views where it is practicable to do so.

You must therefore consider their motivations in taking on the role and the extent to which they are best placed to understand and promote and protect the person\u2019s best interests. For this reason a family member is often the most obvious choice for suitable person.<\/p>\n<figure>You should be mindful of any potential conflicts of interest or family members feeling obliged to take on the role rather than freely agreeing to do so. As a social care practitioner you should ensure that there is no overt or subtle pressure placed upon anyone to become the suitable person.<\/figure>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Do they have the necessary advice about what the role entails to consent to act as the suitable person?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You should be able to explain to anyone considering the role what it will entail.

This may stem from expectations held by the person who lacks capacity or other family members. The potential suitable person may also experience other demands such as care commitments or holding down a job.

She is uncertain about where she is and does not always recognise her personal assistants. She temporarily loses her capacity to make decisions and her daughter, who visits her regularly, speaks to the local council. It is agreed that while Barbara is unwell, her daughter will manage the direct payments and other financial matters for her.

Prior to receiving direct payments, he attended a day centre for five days a week and received respite care for 56 nights per year. His behaviour was challenging in both services and additional one-to-one support was required to enable him to engage in any activities.<\/p>\n<p>Mr F\u2019s council has recently moved to make personal budgets its mainstream delivery mechanism for social care. It was felt that Mr F might benefit from the flexibility and choice provided by direct payments and so his father reduced his day centre attendance to three days a week and employed a personal assistant to provide support on other days. With the family\u2019s general agreement, Mr F\u2019s father was appointed as a suitable person to manage the direct payments and has been able to employ a small team of care workers to support his son, limiting changes in staff contact and providing a seamless service for Mr F.<\/p>\n<p>Mr F is now also able to take part in activities at his mother\u2019s house, with whom he stays on a regular basis. Mr F now has a personal budget comprising a mixed package of care that includes local authority provision, Independent Living Fund (ILF)-funded care and direct payments. The combination enables him to benefit from formal daycare, short breaks, social and leisure activities, domestic support and personal care. He appears to be much happier; he engages more with staff and peers and presents far less challenging behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>(From the DH guidance on direct payments, 2009)<\/p>\n<h3>Case study: involvement in decision making through non-verbal communication<\/h3>\n<p>Kirsten is a young woman aged 27. She has multiple impairments \u2013 both physical and cognitive \u2013 and has complex health needs and epilepsy (which is not controlled). Kirsten does not use verbal language to communicate nor does she understand verbal language. Her cognitive ability is such that she cannot make abstract decisions about the future. She communicates through gestures, body movements, emotions and changes in her routine behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>When Kirsten left school, aged 19, she started in a day service five days each week. The service worked well \u2013 Kirsten showed that she was happy and enjoyed going through smiles, eye contact with staff, laughing, blowing kisses and eating well. However, after about three years, staff in the service noticed that towards the end of the week Kirsten started to be less interested in the activities, fell asleep regularly and often did not want to eat. Kirsten\u2019s family felt that she was telling them that five days in the same environment was too much.<\/p>\n<p>(From the DH guidance on direct payments, 2009)<\/p>\n<h3>Case study: planning transition for young people lacking capacity<\/h3>\n<p>Michael is an 18-year-old man with severe learning disabilities and challenging behaviour who lives with his parents and his older brother. Several years ago, the introduction of direct payments to enable Michael\u2019s parents to purchase support for him had a hugely positive impact on the whole family. Michael had responded well to the personal assistants employed and had become calmer and less aggressive, indicating to his family and professionals familiar with his circumstances that he was happy with the arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>As Michael approached the age of 18, discussions were held between the children\u2019s services team, the senior nurse from the community team for learning disability, the direct payments support team and Michael\u2019s family about his future support arrangements. As the care package had been running so successfully for such a long time, it was decided that it would be in Michael\u2019s best interests for his mother to act as a suitable person and so continue to receive direct payments to manage his support. The decision was made by means of a multi-disciplinary meeting which emphasised that Michael\u2019s best interests were of first priority. All the parties concerned agreed that he was to be at the centre of all decision making and that every effort should be made to ascertain his views about how his care should be delivered.<\/p>\n<p>(From the DH guidance on direct payments, 2009)<\/p>\n<h3>Case study: a family member receiving direct payments on behalf of an older deaf-blind person who lacks capacity<\/h3>\n<p>Anne became deaf-blind as she grew older and started to use direct payments to employ a communicator guide. She lives with her daughter Susan and when planning for the future, she decided to give Susan Lasting Power of Attorney for both financial and personal welfare decisions. Anne has now developed dementia and is unable to consent to receive direct payments herself. Therefore Susan can become a suitable person and receive direct payments on behalf of her mother. Susan is happy to take on this role and employs the communicator guide herself. She receives support from the local direct payments support service that manage staff payroll and work out the quarterly tax and National Insurance payments.<\/p>\n<p>(Adapted from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sense.org.uk\/content\/direct-payments-receiving-direct-payments-behalf-adult-who-lacks-capacity-consent\" target=\"_blank\">Sense website<\/a>)<\/p>\n<h3>Case study: a surrogate being consulted about appointing a suitable person<\/h3>\n<p>A few years ago Mustafa gave his partner Lasting Power of Attorney (an LPA) for welfare that covers securing services to meet his care needs.

Sometimes specialist help, from a psychologist or a speech and language therapist will be required, but it remains the responsibility of the person proposing to make the decision (the \u2018decision-maker\u2019) to ensure that an assessment is carried out.<\/p>\n<h3>Attorney<\/h3>\n<p>A person with authority under Lasting power of Attorney (LPA) or Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) who has legal right to make decisions within the scope of their authority on behalf of the person (the donor) who made the Power of Attorney. People can be an LPA for welfare, property and affairs or both.<\/p>\n<h3>Best Interests<\/h3>\n<p>Any decision made or action taken on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done in their best interests.

People who chose to receive a direct payment use the money to purchase care, support, services or equipment that the council would otherwise provide or commission.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct Payment Support Services<\/h3>\n<p>Services often provided by independent organisations, such as Centres for Independent Living, to provide support and advice to people using direct payments. Some councils provide these services in-house.<\/p>\n<h3>Indirect Payments<\/h3>\n<p>Indirect payments are a form of direct payment. They are used where a person lacks capacity to consent to direct payment, but it is considered to be in their best interests to use them to purchase their care and support. Indirect payments are paid to a &#8216;suitable person&#8217; to manage on behalf of the person who lacks capacity.<\/p>\n<h3>Lasting Power of Attorney<\/h3>\n<p>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) \u2013 a power created under the Mental Capacity Act allowing a person to donate authority to an attorney (or attorneys) to make decisions about their personal welfare (including healthcare) and\/or property and affairs if they lack capacity to make these decisions themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>Mental Capacity<\/h3>\n<p>Mental capacity is the ability to make a decision about a particular matter at the time the decision needs to be made.<\/p>\n<h3>Mental Capacity Act<\/h3>\n<p>The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (sometimes referred to as the MCA) came into force in England and Wales in 2007. The Act aims to empower and protect people who may not be able to make some decisions for themselves. It also enables people to plan ahead in case they are unable to make important decisions for themselves in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"The Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice\" href=\"http:\/\/www.publicguardian.gov.uk\/mca\/code-of-practice.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice<\/a> provides guidance on how the the Act works on a day-to-day basis.
